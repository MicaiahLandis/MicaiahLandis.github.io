            <p class="about-text">
                I was born in Harrisonburg Virginia while my dad was in seminary at Eastern Mennonite Seminary. 
                After finishing his degree my family at this time being my mother, father, sister and I moved to Croghan NY where
                I have spent most of my life. Pictured here from left to right is me, my brother Samuel, my sister
                Jessie, my father Ken and my mother Rosetta. We are standing outside our current house in Croghan NY.
            </p>
            <p class="about-text">
                In Croghan New York I was a student at Beaver River Central School, Kindergarten through 12th
                grade. I graduated from Beaver River in June of 2021. During my time at home I spent most of 
                my free time working with my dad in our woods and various projects around our property including
                a full house remodel when we moved to our current house in 2017.

            <p class="about-text">
                One of my hobbies I have enjoyed for several years is road cycling. Since I started cycling I have
                biked in several bike rides/races and completed 6 centuries with groups and by myself.
                My father got me into cycling and keeps me trying to stay faster than him, even though he is 31 
                years older than me. I have ventured into triathlons as well and have completed 4 sprint races.

                Another Hobby of mine is cinematography. I have been making short videos and short films for 
                several years and enjoyed finding doing it with whatever subjects I had around varying from 
                a go-kart to plants to myself. Check out my YouTube channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@micjonstudios7272" target="_blank">here</a>.

            <p class="about-text">
                At EMU one of my favorite activities is playing Ultimate Frisbee with the student Ultimate Club. 
                This has been a way to take a break from studying for a bit and get more running miles in every
                week. Upon moving to Anchorage I have enjoyed playing with the Alaska Ultimate community that plays in Anchorage.

            <img src="images/about/MicCello.webp" alt="Micaiah Orchestra" class="images" style="float: left;">
            <p class="about-text">
                When applying as a student to EMU I applied for a music scholarship to participate in EMU's Chamber 
                Orchestra. Upon receiving this yearly scholarship I have participated in Chamber Orchestra every 
                semester I have been a student. Since my sophomore year I have had the opportunity to lead the cello
                section as principal cellist. This has helped me to push myself to be a better cellist and leader.
                Cello continues to be my favorite way to express myself through music and I hope to continue to find
                ways to make music whatever I go.

            <p class="about-text">
                In 2023 my father bought a solar business to start a new career in solar contracting. 
                Although a full-time student I enjoy working with him on jobs whenever I am home. I have helped
                install panels on our own rack-mounted solar array and on other job sites. This can involve assembling 
                racking, installing panels and hooking up power for both grid-tied and off-grid systems.

            <p class="about-text">
                Growing up on a large plot of mostly forested land has caused me to love spending time in the woods.
                This can be through hiking, camping, hammocking and fort building. To the right is a picture of 
                my brother and sister and I on a backpacking trip to a nearby lake with a lean-to for camping.

            <img src="/images/about/maple.webp" alt="Micaiah Maple-Syrup" class="images" style="float: Right;">
            <p class="about-text">
                In the part of New York state that I grew up in making maple syrup was very common. In middle 
                school I found a growing desire to get involved in this industry. With my dad we built a small 
                maple evaporator to boil the sap from maple trees into maple syrup. This is a long process as 
                it takes 40 gallons of sap to make one gallon of syrup. 
            </p>
            <p class="about-text">
                The following few years my dad and I grew our operation into larger faster boiling sheds and pans 
                until we could tap nearly 500 taps and make over 70 gallons of maple syrup in one year. Pictured 
                here is a photo from our most recent year of operation (2022).
