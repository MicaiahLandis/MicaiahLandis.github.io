          <p class="about-text">After buying my first Onewheel, a Onewheel Pint in 2022, 
            I slowly learned that I wanted more range. The Onewheel Pint delivers plenty of
            torque but has a limited range of 7 miles. Onewheels with larger range, Onewheel 
            XR and GT, cost over $2000. To create a cheaper long-range board, I decided I wanted
            to purchase a used Onewheel Plus due to its low cost, larger size, and most 
            importantly, ability to be easily modified.

      <!-- First Taken Apart -->
      <section>
        <img src="/images/projects/onewheel/old/IMG_5282.jpg" alt="Taken Apart" class="images" style="float: right;">
        <p class="about-text">I found a Onewheel Plus on Facebook Marketplace for $550
          that included an extra external battery. Since it had an external battery, I had no
          doubt that its power source could be modified. I needed a Onewheel that would 
          operate as long as the controller received the correct voltage but did not require
          any communication between motor controller and BMS. The Onewheel Plus is only the 
          second board made by Future Motion and thus did not require any communication
          between these two devices.

      <!-- Problems -->
      <section>
        <img src="/images/projects/onewheel/old/IMG_5284.jpg" alt="Problems" class="images" style="float: left;">
        <p class="about-text">
          Soon after buying this board, as any engineer might do, I took it apart. 
          The seller told me that the main battery in the board was not working and he 
          had added an extra external battery. So the Onewheel did work when I bought it, 
          but only with the external battery. The seller had supplied an additional Onewheel 
          battery to replace the current one. This was why I took it apart.
        </p>
        <p class="about-text">
          After swapping the batteries, I found that the battery was not the cause of the 
          need for the external battery. After another deconstruction and some research,
          I found that the BMS was probably the cause of my problem. This led me to a 
          more immediate battery build.

      <!-- First Design -->
      <section>
        <img src="/images/projects/onewheel/old/IMG_5350.jpg" alt="Pack1" class="images" style="float: right;">
        <p class="about-text">
          To build a cheap, performant battery, I sourced some INR21700M50LT cells from <a href="https://www.batteryhookup.com" target="_blank">Battery Hookup</a>
          for about $1.70 per cell. These are 5000 mAh 14.4A max discharge cells. My goal was to build a 14s3p pack allowing 
          for a max current of 43.2A. I purchased a 100A smart Bluetooth BMS to manage the pack. This pack was 756Wh or 15Ah 
          up from the stock 2.6Ah. 
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <img src="/images/projects/onewheel/old/IMG_5391.JPG" alt="BMS location" class="images" style="float: left;">
        <p class="about-text">
          Unfortunately, this pack could not fit inside the normal battery compartment even with my custom 3D printed 
          Battery box and aftermarket rear bumper from <a href="https://www.thefloatlife.com" target="_blank">The Float Life</a>.
          To accommodate this large pack, I placed the BMS on top of the box and made the foot pad go over it, making 
          the rear foot pad higher than the front.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <img src="/images/projects/onewheel/old/IMG_5396.jpg" alt="Fail" class="images" style="float: right;">
        <p class="about-text">
          This pack came to a halt when one cell hit its bottom voltage of 2.5V when the rest were still around 3.7V.
          At its worst, along with some bad BMS configurations, this caused the board to give out long before it should 
          have, while moving 20mph.
        </p>
      </section>
      
      <section>
        <p class="about-text">
          I later built a 14s2p pack with P42A cells which are 4200mAh and 45A Max discharge. I also used two 
          different BMS's and redesigned my battery box to accomdate the battery and the BMS along with a stronger
          over all design.
          More Information on this design coming soon...
