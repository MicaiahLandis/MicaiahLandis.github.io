        <h2 class="card-title">Onewheel mods and upgrades</h2>
        <p class="project-text" style="text-indent: 2em;">
          This project began with my purchase of a partially working Onewheel plus. I was looking for a battery project with the 
          purchase of this board so was not upset to find thats its BMS was not working. My first goal was to build a battery 
          that could replace the original battery with upgraded range and equal or more power. 
        </p>
        <h5 class="card-title">V1</h5>
        <p class="project-text" style="text-indent: 2em;">
          My first battery, lets call this v1, was a 14s3p INR21700M50LT pack. I had no expierence building onewheel batteries at 
          this time and wasfairly disconnected with the aftermarket community. To summarize this battery was a disaster waiting 
          to happen. In order to fit this many cells in the frame I had to put the BMS on top of the battery box, in the footpad. 
          The first thing to fail on this build was the welds. I used a cheap battery spot welder and had no prior expierence 
          building batteries so my connections were weak. 
        </p>

        <p class="project-text" style="text-indent: 2em;">
            Since I used a smart BMS on this build I first noticed a cell dropping in voltage much faster than the rest. Once
            disecting this battery I found several loose welds likely to have caused the cell's voltage drops.
        </p>

        <h5 class="card-title">V2</h5>
        <p class="project-text" style="text-indent: 2em;">
          After a bit more research I started planning my next battery build. This was a 14s2p pack using Molicel P42B's. For the 
          BMS I used a Daly 14s smart bms. I had also upgraded to a Glitter 801D spot welder for much stronger welds. I used 0.2mm 
          nickel strips for all welds. The first falure of this build was a cell going out of balance. Since it was cell 14, the
          last in the string I simply replaced that cell. I also swapped my bms to a JBD 12-17s smart BMS for better active balance.
        </p>
        <img src="../images/projects/onewheel/v2dally.webp" class="img-fluid rounded shadow prof" alt="Screenshot 1">
        <p class="project-text" style="text-indent: 2em;">
          The main flaws on this build can be seen in the above picture.
        </p>

        <li class="project-text" style="text-indent: 2em;">Easily the biggest mistake was not using any fish paper.</li>
        <li class="project-text" style="text-indent: 2em;">Weak physical build.</li>
        <li class="project-text" style="text-indent: 2em;">Poor routing of balance lines.</li>
        
        <p class="project-text" style="text-indent: 2em;">
          Since I was still new to battery building I was not aware of teh importance of fish paper. I placed the cells tight 
          to each other, using only the welds to bind them until I taped them all together. While this seemed to work it was 
          difficult to assemble and not prepared for the vigorous vibrations of onewheeling. One of my theories of the cause
          of v2's second bad cell and ultimate falure was the lack of fish paper. Several cells showed signs of corrosion,
          and a few had parts where the nickel strips had worn through the battery heat shrink making contact with the metal 
          of the cell.
        </p>
        <p class="project-text" style="text-indent: 2em;">
          Although never proving to cause any problem the balance wires were routed in such a way that they over lapped each
          other many times. In a tight build like a onewheel this can cause a short over time with many vibrations.
        </p>
