        <h2 class="card-title">EMU Planetarium Projector</h2>
        <p class="project-text" style="text-indent: 2em;">
          The first goal of this project was to get the projector moving on all axes and projecting
           the stars. In order to reduce the astronomical knowledge required to use the projector, a
            desired feature was to be able to input a time, date and location for any place on earth
             and have the projector move to show what the stars look like then. In order to achieve 
             this, the motion system needed to be upgraded to acquire full control over the projector.
              Projection of the stars was still to come from the original xenon lamp with the difference
               being that along with motion and other parts of the projector, the light would be 
               toggleable from a digital interface.
          </p>
          <p class="project-text" style="text-indent: 2em;">
            With the upgrade to new NEMA17 stepper motors and gearboxes on each axis more torque and 
            speed was available. When powered on and the calibration sequence runs, the axis all move 
            in a set direction until the break beams align and for axis 3 the beams break. This sets 
            all current positions to known values for later positioning. From this the planetarium 
            can move to known positions to show specific skies. Through a multistep upgrade process 
            the original xenon starball lamp was upgraded to an modern LED source. Through use of a 
            fisheye lens a very similar star projection was achieved on the dome of the planetarium 
            room. Additionally projections for the ecliptic, latitude and meridian lines, equatorial 
            coordinates, geo earths, pole lights, twilight, cardinal points, and constellations of 
            Orion and Cassiopeia are all fully functional. While positioning control of the planets 
            was not part of this project's goals, they are still able to be turned on and off. The 
            custom designed base allows the planetarium to roll on casters across the room and easily 
            be lifted up off the wheels with a ratcheting mechanism so that it is level and stationary. 
            The base has storage for all of the curtains and other commonly used items easily 
            accessible from cabinet doors. The web app created is able to control continuous motion of 
            each axis and turn on and off each light in an intuitive four page interface. One of the 
            pages takes inputs of latitude and longitude and date and time and moves the projector to 
            show the stars at the specified time and location. Another page on the web app was for 
            doing a show. This page allowed the user to step through the different positions the 
            planetarium would move too as they read a script out loud.
          </p>
          <p class="project-text" style="text-indent: 2em;">
            Once the projector was operable and tested for reliability, many demonstrations were given 
            to show off the features of the projector, both new and old. Reactions were positive, with 
            people viewing the stars finding it to be an enjoyable experience even though this technology 
            is heavily outdated compared to modern planetarium projectors. One full show was planned and 
            put on using one of the original scripts from when the planetarium was open. This show focused 
            on showing off to people who were involved in running the planetarium, providing a valuable 
            experience in recreating many memories of a place that holds so many for multiple generations 
            of people.
