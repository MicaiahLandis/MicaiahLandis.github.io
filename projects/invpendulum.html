          The main constraint of this project was to build the inverted pendulum system at a total cost of $500, 
          while creating a robust system that will continue to be used for future control system classes and research. 
          After calculating system accuracy requirements, mechanical and electrical components were found to match 
          the specifications. A full CAD (Computer Aided Design)  assembly was modeled using Solidworks 
          and engineering drawings created for individual parts. The subsections of the system are the steel base, 
          linear guide system, motor and belt drive, pendulum arms and pivots, and electronics and sensors. After 
          procuring materials and components, the individual parts were manufactured using 3D printing, machining, 
          and welding. The final design allows for the system to be used as a single and double inverted pendulum 
          without removing any parts.

          <p class="project-text" style="text-indent: 2em;">
          A framework for an Arduino based PID controller was developed using ChatGPT, with separate PIDs for each 
          controlled motion. PID controller outputs, encoder angles and time were collected to create graphs for 
          tuning purposes. The encoders are calibrated by aligning the arms in a vertical position with the Arduino 
          reading and storing the position. Safety limits are programmed that if a cart position or angle threshold 
          is exceeded, the motor is disabled.

          <p class="project-text" style="text-indent: 2em;">
          The controller that balances the first beam was tuned using Ziegler Nichols method2. This was done by 
          increasing the proportional constant until the system reached continuous oscillation, with the period 
          of oscillation and required proportional constant then used to calculate values for P, I and D. In order 
          to tune the PID controller that centers the cart, the graphs of system and controller data were analyzed 
          to determine values for P, I and D. The proportional constant was increased until the system responded 
          quickly to error. The derivative constant was added to remove overshoot, and a small amount of integral 
          was added to reduce steady state error.

        </p>

        <p class="project-text" style="text-indent: 2em;">
            A double inverted pendulum system was designed and constructed for a cost slightly over $500.
             A controller was successfully programmed and tuned to balance a single inverted pendulum. 
             The controller proved successful at handling small disturbances, removing a human caused force input 
             to the arm in less than two seconds. At point A in the graph below, the pendulum arm is given
              a slight push causing it to deflect. This causes the cart and arm PID controllers to ramp up their 
              outputs, leading the cart to move significantly away from the center. The cart movement causes the arm
               to change its rotational direction at point B, approximately 120 milliseconds after the disturbance 
               occurred. From here both PID outputs begin to level off and switch directions, with the cart PID 
               output having a slight lag. Around point C, the PID outputs approach each other, the cart and arm 
               change directions. The rate at which the cart moves back towards center causes the arm to rotate back
                toward the upright position in a damped path with slight overshoot. By the time point D is reached,
                 the signals have mostly converged resulting in near steady state.
