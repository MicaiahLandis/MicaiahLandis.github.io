            <p>Summer of 2024 I worked for JZ Engineering as an intern inspecting bridges.
              Since 2015 JZ Engineering has partnered with Mennonite Disaster Service and
               West Virginia Voad to design and build residential bridges in places in need.
               My job was to travel around West Virginia and inspect the bridges that 
               were built 5-9 years ago, specifcally looking at corrosion and wood wear on the bridges.

                Before I enrolled at Eastern Mennonite University I spent almost my entire life in Croghan 
                NY. To fill my time in Croghan I often roamed the outdoors, helping my father on house and 
                barn projects. For several years we had several goats and many chickens that were treated more as pets
                 than farm animals. As I transitioned into high school my parents bought a new property 
                 with over 100 acres.

                With endless opportunities my dad and I spent lots of time in our woods
                  making trails and caring for trees. Evolving from this we started collecting sap from 
                  maple trees in the spring months to make maple syrup. This became one of my favorite 
                  activities, combining being outside with my family and friends with the process of tapping 
                  maple trees, collecting sap and boiling it into syrup.

                Several summers in highschool and college I worked for a local heating and air conditioning
                 contractor helping on installs and maintenance. This gave me valuable experience in the 
                 workforce and how to effectively work with coworkers. In college I worked alongside my father
                  in his solar contracting business installing solar units and upgrading aging systems. 
                  I learned a lot about both AC and DC power and how solar systems work from the physical 
                  panels to battery charge controllers, Inverters and grid tied power managers.
