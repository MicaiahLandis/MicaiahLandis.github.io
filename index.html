        <h1>Hi, my name is Micaiah</h1>
        <p>I am a mechanical EIT interested in clean energy, effecient tranportation and optimization of common systems. 
          I am proficient in several engineering software apps including: AutoCAD, Autodesk Inventor and Solidworks.
        </p>
        <p>In my free time I enjoy designing, modding and optimizing 3D printing. My favorite printer I own is a 
          <a href="https://vorondesign.com/voron0.2" target="_blank" >Voron 0.2</a> I built from a kit. Since it's an open 
          source project I am constantly improving and optimizing different parts. I am experienced building Li-ion battery
          packs for various electrical devices and designing custom PCBs for smallelectrical uses. All of these I go into 
          depth on in the <a href="projects.html">projects page</a>.</p>

      <!-- Internship Experience -->
      <div class="col-12">
        <p>Summer of 2024 I worked for <a href="https://jzengr.com" target="_blank">JZ Engineering</a> as an engineering 
          intern inspecting bridges. Since 2015 JZ Engineering has partnered with 
          <a href="https://www.mds.org" target="_blank">Mennonite Disaster Service</a> and 
          <a href="https://www.wvvoad.org/" target="_blank">West Virginia VOAD</a> to design and build residential bridges
          in natural disaster sites. My job was to travel throughout West Virginia and inspect the bridges that were built 
          5-9 years ago, specifically looking at corrosion and wood wear on the bridges.</p>

      <!-- Childhood Background -->
      <div class="col-12">
        <p>Before I enrolled at Eastern Mennonite University I spent almost my entire life in Croghan NY. To fill my time
          in Croghan I often roamed the outdoors, helping my father on house and barn projects. As I transitioned into 
          high school my parents bought a new property with over 100 acres.</p>

      <!-- Maple Syrup & Outdoor Activities -->
      <div class="col-12">
        <p>With endless opportunities my dad and I spent lots of time in our woods making trails and caring for trees. 
          Evolving from this we started collecting sap from maple trees in the spring months to make maple syrup. This 
          became one of my favorite activities, combining being outside with my family and friends with the process of 
          tapping maple trees, collecting sap and boiling it into syrup.</p>
        <p>Several summers in high school and college I worked for a local heating and air conditioning contractor 
          helping on installs and maintenance. This gave me valuable experience in the workforce and how to effectively 
          work with coworkers. In my college years I worked alongside my father in his solar contracting business installing 
          solar units and upgrading aging systems. I learned a lot about both AC and DC power and how solar systems 
          work from the physical panels to battery charge controllers, inverters, and grid-tied power managers.</p>
