        <p>I am a student at Eastern Mennonite 
            University pursuing my BS in Engineering. At EMU I am a member of our 
            Shell Eco Marathon team
            as well as first chair cellist of the EMU Chamber Orchestra.</p>
        <p>I enjoy designing, modding and optimizing 3D printing and have two printers including a voron I built. 
            I am expierenced building Li-ion Battery packs for varius electrical devices and desiging 
            custom PCB's for small electrical uses. All of these I go into depth on in the 
            <a href="projects.html">projects page</a>.</p>
        <p>Summer of 2024 I worked for JZ Engineering as an intern inspecting bridges.
            Since 2015 JZ Engineering has partnered with Mennonite Disaster Service and
             West Virginia Voad to design and build residential bridges in places in need.
             My job was to travel around West Virginia and inspect the bridges that 
             were built 5-9 years ago, specifcally looking at corrosion and wood wear on the bridges.

        Before I enrolled at Eastern Mennonite University I spent almost my entire life in Croghan 
        NY. To fill my time in Croghan I often roamed the outdoors, helping my father on house and 
        barn projects. For several years we had several goats and many chickens that were treated more as pets
        than farm animals. As I transitioned into high school my parents bought a new property 
        with over 100 acres.

        With endless opportunities my dad and I spent lots of time in our woods
        making trails and caring for trees. Evolving from this we started collecting sap from 
        maple trees in the spring months to make maple syrup. This became one of my favorite 
        activities, combining being outside with my family and friends with the process of tapping 
        maple trees, collecting sap and boiling it into syrup.

        Several summers in highschool and college I worked for a local heating and air conditioning
        contractor helping on installs and maintenance. This gave me valuable experience in the 
        workforce and how to effectively work with coworkers. In college I worked alongside my father
        in his solar contracting business installing solar units and upgrading aging systems. 
        I learned a lot about both AC and DC power and how solar systems work from the physical 
        panels to battery charge controllers, Inverters and grid tied power managers.
